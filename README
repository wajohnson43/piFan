A simple program to control a fan for a Raspberry Pi Cluster.

"sudo make driver" creates and sets up all the files to control the fan, and to recieve temperature readings from another pi.

"sudo make sender" sets up all the files send temperature to another pi.

IP addresses and maximum temperature have been hardcoded, and will need to be changed.

Authentication and further scalability have not been considered.
